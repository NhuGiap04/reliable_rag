# Reliable Reasoning on Retrieval Generation Tasks

This project aims to improve reliable reasoning in Multi-hop Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by incorporating Knowledge Graphs into the retrieval and inference process. By decomposing complex queries into sub-questions and reasoning over structured knowledge extracted from retrieved documents, the proposed method enhances factual consistency and reduces error propagation during multi-hop question answering.
